# Modelling: Course Project
Modeling of deliveries of Porsche cars from the car assembly line to dealers using intermediate regional warehouses to
minimize their delivery time.

**System description:**

Auto dealers get requests from customers who want to buy new Porsche cars. When dealer collects a bunch of requests it
orders appropriate amount of cars from the central office. The latter should in acceptable time and for minimal cost
ship them. To minimize the time company decides to build regional warehouses to store cars there right after
manufacturing. Therefore cars would be delivered to dealers from warehouses and waiting time would be reduced.
